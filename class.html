        // class = a blueprint for creating objects
//         defines what properties and methods they have
//         use a constructor for unique properties

// in a class with a given set of instructions,  multiple objects can be created, e.g

class player{
 Score = 15;

Start(){
    console.log("You've stsrted the game, click any button to continue")
}
exit(){
    console.log("Are you sure you wanna exit this game?")
}

// Now you can create one or more object with it
// lets say we have 2 players

 let player1 = new player();
 let player2 = new player();
 // now you can set any property or method for each of the player
 
 player1.Score += 1;
 player2.Score += 2;

 console.log(`Your score is ${player1.Score}, While your friend score is ${player2.Score}`)
