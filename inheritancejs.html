        // inheritance = a child class can inherit all the methods and properties from another class
        // if you have multiple classes with the same properties and methods, like they have some properties and method to be coommon
        // you can cide those methods and properties in a parent class and other children classes will have access to it
        // An exampleis the animal class, because animals have a commmon property and method, an example will be given below.
  
        // Lets first create the animal class, which will contain all they have in common

        // we now create a children class that have access to these properties and methods
        // as if they are written in the class itself
        // "extends parentclass" where "parentclass is name of the parent", is used to inherit those properties
        // and methods in the parent class
        // note: in order for a method to be executed, an object must be created  from the class first.
